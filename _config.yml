user_description: Originally from Poland, now living in LA (not limited to), I am a systems and network engineer with a passion for building and automating (and all the fun stuff in between). Some would call this DevOps/SysOps/NetOps/SRE. With success in both startup and corporate enviroments having worn many hats, seven years of experience, a desire to learn and a dedication to honing my craft, I look forward to my next challenge.

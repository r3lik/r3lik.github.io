user_description: I am a systems and network engineer with a passion for building and automating (and all the fun stuff in between). Some would call this SysOps/NetOps/DevOps. With success in both startup and corporate enviroments having worn many hats, seven years of experience, a passion to learn and a dedication to honing my craft, I look forward to my next challenge :]

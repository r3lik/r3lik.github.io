user_description: Originally from Poland, now living in LA (not limited to), I am a systems and network engineer with a passion for building and automating (and all the fun stuff in between). Some would call this DevOps/SysOps/NetOps/SRE. I've had some success in both startup and corporate enviroments having worn many hats during a seven year career. My focus has recently shifted from traditional cloud and bare-metal services to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, an area that I'm excited about contributing to, and which I believe will become the next disruptive layer of the internet.
